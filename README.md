preprocessing.py & visualization.py added

preprocessng.py (Please run with python 2.7)

Generate the csv file for visualization.
Please change the variable "start" and "end" to the start index and end index of the *.post files.
For example, if you want to merge 1.post - 15.post, please set:
start = 1,
end = 15

Please note that in python3, the url will be automatically read from the body, thus making the body of the post very long(which is annoying). Please run this file with python2.7 if possible.
If you don't have python2.7. Please download this file from:

post 1 - post 15
